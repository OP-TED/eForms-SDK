# Summary
This project is managed by the Publications Office of the European Union to enable implementation of the European legislation for publication of notices for public procurement on the [TED website](https://ted.europa.eu/TED/). For more information, see the [DG GROW eForms](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/digital/eforms_en) page. 

This project aims to provide the necessary tools for being able to build valid eForms notices.
It is composed of the following folders:
- `codelists`: The codelists used in eForms notices, as [Genericode files](https://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/genericode/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html).
- `schemas`: The XML schemas used for eForms notices. There are based on Pre-Award document types of the [UBL 2.3 standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.3.html).
The adopted approach is to keep the whole set of UBL elements but only support the use of a subset. It provides the advantage of having the rules outside of the schema. Adding extra fields for which a UBL element already exists will not require the definition of a new schema.
- `efx-grammar`: The ANTLR grammar for the eForms expression language (EFX).
- `schematrons`: The Schematron rules used to check the validity of notices as per the eForms regulation. Any kind of rule or constraint is implemented in Schematron.
- `examples`: Examples of eForms notices together with their validation report in SVRL.
- `notice-types`: Definitions of each type of notice, in JSON.
- `fields`: Information on the fields that compose an eForms notice.
- `view-templates`: Structured information on the visualisation of notices.
- `translations`: Translations of various labels and short texts used in eForms notices.

The documentation is available at https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest.

# Versioning

The eForms SDK uses semantic versioning. For more information: https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/versioning

Provisional releases of the eForms schema and documentation that were provided during 2020 via SIMAP had a different versioning scheme and are replaced with this SDK that combines them into one bundle with one version number.
