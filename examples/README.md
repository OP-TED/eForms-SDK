# Examples

The files available in this folder are published to provide examples to anyone implementing the eForms regulation.

## Notices

The folder "notices" contains examples of eForms XML notices.

The notices with a filename starting with "INVALID_" are intentionally invalid, and are used to assess the completeness of the validation rules.

Some of the notices are based on a notice published on TED, and in that case the link to that notice is indicated in a comment at the start of the file.

The notices "cn_24_FRA_comments.xml" and "can_24_FRA_comments.xml" are of specific interest, as they are quite exhaustive, and contain comments referring to the corresponding Business Terms.


## Validation reports

The folder "reports" contains the results of the validation of the notice examples with the Schematron rules provided in this repository.

The validation reports are in SVRL (Schematron Validation Report Language). 

Each report has the same filename as the corresponding notice, with the extension ".svrl".
