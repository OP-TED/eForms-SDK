# Search fields

These files provide a mapping from field id to the location of the data in the XML via EFX.

For example here BI is the search field ID and "efx" holds the full EFX:
```
    "BI": {
		"efx": "{ND-Root} ${BT-501-Organization-Company[OPT-200-Organization-Company == OPT-300-Procedure-Buyer]}",
		"comment": "Buyer registration number"
	},
```
