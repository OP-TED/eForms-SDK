# SDK 2.0.0 Release Notes

SDK 2.0.0 introduces a new, more expressive version of EFX (the eForms Expression Language) which allows us to improve the visualisation of eForms notices, as well as the expressiveness and readability of business rules.

Some of the changes introduced with eForms SDK 2, are not backwards compatible with earlier releases. Applications that use SDK 1.x,x, will need to be updated to use the new version of the SDK. 

A detailed list of changes as well as a complete migration guide are available in the [eForms SDK 2 "Welcome" document](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/home/eforms/sdk2/).

The documentation for the SDK is available at <https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest>. The source for this documentation is maintained in the [eforms-docs](https://github.com/OP-TED/eforms-docs) repository.

A comprehensive list of changes between SDK 1.7.0 and SDK 2.0.0 can be seen at <https://github.com/OP-TED/eForms-SDK/compare/1.7.0...2.0.0>.
