As new rules were added, a notice that was valid with SDK 1.9.x might not be valid with this version.

The documentation for the SDK is available at <https://docs.ted.europa.eu>. The source for this documentation is maintained in the [eforms-docs](https://github.com/OP-TED/eforms-docs) repository.

This release note does not cover the details of all changes.

A comprehensive list of changes between SDK 1.9.0 and SDK 1.10.0 can be seen at <https://github.com/OP-TED/eForms-SDK/compare/1.9.0...1.10.0>
