# SDK 1.1.1 Release Notes

This release of the SDK does not contain any backwards incompatible changes: software that was able to use version 1.0.0 should also be able to use this version.

This is a patch to provide some additional files needed by the TED website.

This release has no impact on eSenders. The eForms metadata are identical to 1.1.0.

The documentation for the SDK is available at <https://docs.ted.europa.eu>. The source for this documentation is maintained in the [eforms-docs](https://github.com/OP-TED/eforms-docs) repository.

## Amendment to eForms Regulation

An amendment to the [eForms Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019R1780) will be published in the near future.
This amendment includes changes to Annex II.
It introduces new Business Terms, and modifies some existing Business Terms, affecting names, descriptions and rules.

Some of those changes have been implemented in this release, and correspond to most of the changes listed above. The remaining changes will be implemented in a future release.
