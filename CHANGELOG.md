# SDK 1.1.1 Release Notes

This release of the SDK does not contain any backwards incompatible changes: software that was able to use version 1.0.0 should also be able to use this version.

This is a patch to provide some additional files needed by the TED website.

This release has no impact on eSenders. The eForms metadata are identical to 1.1.0.

The documentation for the SDK is available at <https://docs.ted.europa.eu>. The source for this documentation is maintained in the [eforms-docs](https://github.com/OP-TED/eforms-docs) repository.
