# SDK 1.8.0 Release Notes

This release of the SDK does not contain any backwards incompatible changes: software that was able to use version 1.7.0 should also be able to use this version.

## Updated metadata content

This version brings various changes in the metadata content that were needed for corrections, enhancements and consistency. The following is an overview of the main changes:

* For nodes and fields, missing "xsdSequenceOrder" properties were added, and some values were corrected.

* 18 new example notices were added, for notice subtypes that were not represented in existing examples.

As new rules were added, a notice that was valid with SDK 1.7.x might not be valid with this version.

The documentation for the SDK is available at <https://docs.ted.europa.eu>. The source for this documentation is maintained in the [eforms-docs](https://github.com/OP-TED/eforms-docs) repository.
