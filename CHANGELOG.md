# eForms SDK 2.0.0-alpha.1 Release Notes

SDK 2.0.0-alpha.1 is the first in a series of pre-releases of the upcoming eForms SDK 2.0.0.

## Caution: Pre-release

Please be aware that **this is a pre-release version** intended to give you a chance to preview and follow the development of the next major version of the SDK.  

## Objective

The goal of SDK 2 is to introduce a new, more expressive version of EFX (the eForms Expression Language) which will us to improve the visualisation of eForms notices, as well as the expressiveness and readability of business rules.

## Contents

In short, SDK 2.0.0-alpha.1 consists of a development version of EFX-2, and a development version of SDK 1.9.0.

- SDK 2.0.0-alpha.1 is being released to provide access to the updated grammar of EFX-2.
- The remaining contents of SDK 2.0.0-alpha.1 are borrowed from the current development version of SDK 1.9.0.

A detailed list of changes as well as a complete migration guide are being made available in the [eForms SDK 2 "Welcome" document](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/home/eforms/sdk2/). This documentation evolves as the development of SDK 2 progresses, and therefore it may not be fully updated at all times until the eventual release of SDK 2.0.0.

A comprehensive list of changes between SDK 1.8.0 and SDK 2.0.0-alpha.1 can be seen at <https://github.com/OP-TED/eForms-SDK/compare/1.8.0...2.0.0-alpha.1>.

## Backwards compatibility

Some of the changes introduced with eForms SDK 2, are not backwards compatible with earlier versions. Applications that use SDK 1.x,x, will need to be updated to use the new version of the SDK. More specifically SDK 2.0.0-alpha.1 introduces breaking changes in the EFX grammar.

Further pre-release versions will follow. Future alpha versions may introduce further breaking changes.
