= Competition Results

Competition results are shared using result notices. Such notices have a
single "_efac:NoticeResult_" element containing information about the
latest award decisions and potentially about the lots still to be
awarded.

== Notice Result

The Notice Result section of a Result notice contains different
information (cf. <<noticeResultStructureFigure>>):

* The result for a lot for which the decision was recently made
or is still pending,

* The tenders received for the lots about which a decision has
been made and is shared with the notice,

* The contracts that have been signed following the award of
lots,

* The parties that submitted tenders for the lots of the notice
whose awarding decision has been made and is shared in the notice.

* The aggregated amounts covering all awarded lots of the
notice.

All these elements will be further detailed in the following sections.

[[noticeResultStructureFigure]]
.Overall structure of the Notice Result section
image::image013.jpg[image,width=455,height=298]


It should also be considered that this structure differs from the one
defined by the Standard and to comply with it,
cac:TenderResult/cbc:AwardDate must be present in the XML instance. It
is sufficient to have only one such occurence and the associated
value shall be "2000-01-01".

== Notice aggregated amounts

Notice Value is about the aggregated value of all awarded lots of the
notice.

Notice Framework Value is about the the aggregated Maximum Framework
Value, estimated or actual, for all awarded lots of the noticefootnote:[When a group of lots with a Framework is awarded, the computation should be based on the Framework associated value instead of the ones of the individual lots it is composed of.].

For any group of lots of the notice having a group framework agreement,
the reference to the Group of lots as well as the Group Framework Value
shall be specified. Group Framework Value and its associated reference
to the lot may be "unpublished"; when done so, the dates of publication
for both elements shall be the same.

All these amounts have to be expressed using elements of the
https://op.europa.eu/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/currency[Currency]
codelist to designate the currency as "currencyID" attribute and decimal
numbers.

Further details on the fields may be found in the following table and an
overview of the structure as well as a mark-up excerpt are provided
later on.

== Lot Result

A Notice Result shall contain at least one LotResult with a made
decisionfootnote:[i.e. for which "_cbc:TenderResultCode_" is either "close-nw" or "selec-w".].

LotResult applies exclusively to a single lot. This element contains
various information (cf. table below and against figure):

* Statistics on received submissions (highest & lowest value
tenders, received quantity per submission type),

* Procurement procedure outcome, and when not awarded the
background reason,

* Termination of a DPS,

* Financing and Paying Parties,

* Review requests statistics,

* References to the received tenders for the lot covered by this
result,

* Framework Agreement Values associated to the lot (estimated
and maximal),

* Reference(s) to the contract(s) settled as a result of the
made decision,

* Statistical results for some strategic procurement projects
(e.g. green vehicles),

* Reference to the lot the result applies to.

[[lotResultStructureFigure]]

For each lot, there may not exist more than one LotResult within the
same notice.

== Lot Tender

LotTenders are the results of the decomposition of a received tender
into fragments, each corresponding to a lot or group of lots.

Multiple information items may be found in a LotTender:

* The LotTender ID,

* The Tender Rank,

* The Public transportation cumulated distance (for T02 form
only),

* Whether the tender is a variant or not,

* The tender value,

* Paid & penalties amounts (for _"Contract Completion_" only),

* Concession revenues,

* Contract terms,

* Origin of goods or service,

* Subcontracting terms,

* Reference to the "Contracting Party" that submitted the
tender,
