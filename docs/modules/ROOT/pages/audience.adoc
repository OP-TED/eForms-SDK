= Audience

The main audience of this document is destined to be people in charge of
the technical implementation of the schemas. The technical schemas are
developed to address the new requirements of the eForms Regulation. This
document only covers the XML aspect of the XML instance and does neither
suppose nor address other technical or organisational aspects (e.g.
rendering, information storage ...).
