= Documents, forms & notices

For a common understanding, it is necessary to state what is meant by
"document", "form" and "notice".

[[documentAndDocumentTypeSection]]
== Document and Document Type

The eProcurement Ontology workgroup defined a "document" as:

[quote, ePO workgroup]
____
A set of interrelated Business Information representing the business
facts.
____

With the additional information:

[quote, ePO workgroup]
____
Documents may convey information in any language, medium or form,
including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, audio-visual forms,
etc.
____

We will use the "document" term mainly to refer to the XML document
(i.e. XML instance) containing all information of a given notice.

For eForms we may distinguish three different document types:

* Prior Information Notice,

* Contract Notice, and

* Contract Award Notice.

While most notices belonging to these categories are expected to have
UBL XSD schemas as normative representations, some (e.g. change notices)
may involve non-UBL elements and require the use of extensions.

[[formAndFormTypesSection]]
== Form and Form Types

The eForms Regulation defines a set of forms and their associated fields
foreseen for the edition of procurement notices. A form is an interim
means that assists the contracting authority in the encoding of the
required information.

There are different form types. It is common to use the "form type" name
as a notice attribute to specify its belonging to a specific form type
family (e.g. "Planning Notice" is commonly used to refer to a Notice
that has the "Planning" form type).

The Regulation identifies different form types:

* Planning,
* Competition,
* Direct Award Pre-notification (DAP),
* Result,
* Contract Modification,
* Change.

<<formTypesFigure>> below provides an indicative time-based representation of the
different Form Types. This gives an overview of the potential
successions or coexistence of the different types of forms.

=== Planning forms

Planning forms group notices published before the start of the "Call for
Competition"; these are often qualified as "Planning Notices". Although
"Planning Notices" are not associated to any Procedure and do not have
any EU Procedure Identifier assigned, the buyer may already define and
use an internal Procedure identifier.

=== Competition forms

Competition forms lead to the generation of notices initiating the "Call
for Competition".

=== DAP forms

Direct Award Pre-notification (DAP) forms generate notices stating the
intention to award a contract directly (i.e. without prior call for
competition) to one or more Economic Operators. In contrast to the
Result notices generated from the Result formsfootnote:[For a CAN, when awarded, the contract is signed shortly before; when not awarded, the contract is not signed.]
the DAP notices are published prior to signing the contract. Such
notices should also refer to the existing Procedure and notices that
enable this awarding method.

=== Result forms

Result forms are used to produce result notices, which are published
shortly after contract signature. They refer to the contract notice and
provide award process information like award of contract, winner, etc.

=== Contract Modification forms

During the contract execution, a contract may need modification. If the
start of a new procurement procedure is not needed, then the Contract
Modification forms are used to produce a modification notice reporting
the modifications applied to the contract.

=== Change forms

Change forms are used to produce change notices. The purpose of change
notices is multifold:

* Correct information reported in a previous version of the same
notice (also often referred as "_Corrigenda_"),

* Inform about changes to information not inside the notice
(e.g. changed procurement documents),

Changes may apply to notices of any form type. A Change notice contains
all the information from the initial notice with integrated changes
(i.e. consolidated text), as well as information on applied changes.
When a change is applied to a previous change notice, it must aggregate
all changes from previous versions, and only have the latest changes
described in the change section.

When applying changes, it is essential to ensure that the changes do not
require the buyer to start a new procedure. It is the duty of the buyer
to check that applied changes do not:

* impact the applicable time limits;
* advantage some economic operators at the expense of others;
* require a procedure restart.

[[noticeNoticeTypesAndSubtypesSection]]
== Notice, Notice Types and Subtypes

The ePO workgroup provided the following definition of a "notice":

[quote, ePO workgroup]
_____
Document published by the buyer about market opportunities and results.
_____

As clearly stated in the definition, a document may only be considered
as a notice after publication; however, at business level, it is common
to use the "notice" keyword for notice candidate documents (i.e.
document submitted for publication), even before their validation.

Any notice has an identifier that may be referred to, for change or for
search purpose.

Speaking about "notice" may designate the XML instance or other related
by-products (e.g.: PDF manifestations); in this document, we will mainly
refer to the XML instance.

Regarding notices, shortened expressions are commonly used. As
illustrations, the two following examples may be provided with
expressions like:

* "Planning notice" to refer to a notice of form type
"Planning",

* "PIN profile" or "PIN profile notice" for a notice of notice
type "PIN profile"

A given form type groups multiple notice types as shown on <<noticeTypesSubtypesTable>> in
which form types, document types, notice types, a reference to the
column number of Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2019/1780, and a short
description, are provided.

The concept of Notice Subtype has also been introduded for a quick, easy
and univocal reference to a specific context allowing the identification
of the applicable rules set. For the eForms Regulation annex, the
subtype value corresponds to the column number.
