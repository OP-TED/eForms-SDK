=== Referring to sections of a notice

When creating a change, an author has to identify the notice sections
involved. The section references will be extracted from the Change
notice itself (i.e. the technical identifiers will exist and be known).
The following table lists the usable identifiers available to refer to
the different sections. Section for which the text is in grey italic
can't be modified with a Change notice and there is therefore no code
associated (_NA_).
