= Notices XML structure

The information in the XML instance covers information related to:

* The notice,

* The procurement procedure, and

* The Parts, Lots or Group of Lots.

As shown on <<reusedElementsFigure>> below, the latter two share key structures that
shall be interpreted in their respective contexts.

For simplification, not all information has been represented in the
diagram below and the focus was placed on high level key repeating
elements. Also for uniformity and simplification, Procedures without
lots (and PIN without parts) are to be treated technically as a
procedure with exactly one lot (or part).

Notice information is represented with an orange background; Procurement
Procedure information with a green one; and information for Group of
Lots, Lot, or Part with a purple background.

The contextual use of each of these elements is reported in <<contextualInterpretationOfHighLevelRepeatableElementsTable>>,
which lists the element name, its context and the associated element
purpose (i.e. information it covers).

Further details on these different elements will be provided in <<procedureGroupOfLotsLotPartRelatedInformationSection>> and
following sections.

== The notice metadata

The notice metadata cover the following information:

* Identification of the notice (notice identifier & version),

* Procurement Procedure identifier of the Procedure it belongs
to,

* Notice context (form type, notice type, legal basis),

* Key dates (dispatch, publication, etc.),

* Publication related information (e.g. OJ S no., status,
publication date),

* Notice official linguistic version(s).

== Procedure, Groups of Lots, Lots and Parts

Information about the Procedure, the Groups of Lots, the Lots or the
Parts share the same set of elements at the highest level (i.e.
Tendering Terms, Tendering Process and Procurement Project). <<reusedElementsFigure>>
highlights that these major elements are reused over the instance and
that their meaning is highly linked to the context:

* as direct children of the notice root element, they refer to
the procurement Procedure;

* as children of a Procurement Project Lot element, they refer to the
corresponding Group of Lots, Lot or Part.
