= Parties

*_"Parties"_* refers to the different stakeholders of the public procurement
process. They play different roles (or subroles) during the procedure.
Roles and subroles have been listed in the eForms implementation
handbook.

Should always be used when applicable:

* Buyer,

* Winner,

* Review body,

* Buyer acquiring supplies/services intended for other buyers

* Buyer awarding public contracts or concluding FAs for works,
supplies or services intended for others,

* eSenders.

Information provision about other roles shall follow national specific
requirements and implementations.

More specific rules on organizations to identify, based on their
role/subrole and the type of notice, are given in <<roleSubrolePresencePerNoticeTable>> below.

The Organizations information is centralized and only some function
related properties have been kept in their respective context.

The structure for Organizations information is designed to support the
different classes that may be encountered. In the following sub
sections, information is provided on:

* the different organizations,

* the way they are referred to, and

* the function-related properties that could not be centralized.

[[organizationsInformationDesignSection]]
== Organizations Information design

[[organizationsStructureFigure]]
.Organizations structure
image::image019.png[image,width=208,height=242]

We may distinguish two classes of parties involved in a public
procurement procedure:

* Organizations as such, and

* Ultimate Business Owners.

In the XML, they are all under the same element "_efac:Organizations_"
in the extensions. Their content is somewhat different as an
Organization is most of the time a juridical person while the Ultimate
Beneficial Owner is always a natural one

[[organizationSection]]
== Organization

The required information for an Organization is dependent on its type
and may vary with its function (role within a context).

As the contact details for a given function may differ from the
_Organization_ ones, the concept of _TouchPoint_ has been introduced.
The link between a _TouchPoint_ and an _Organization_ is ensured by the
parent element "_efac:Organization_". An Organization may have zero or
more TouchPoints associated to it, depending on the performed functions
and the existence or not of various communication channels.

[[organizationStructureFigure]]
.Information structure for an organization
image::image020.jpg[image,width=254,height=268]

The "_efac:Company_" element contains the information of the legal
entity while the "_efac:TouchPoint_" element encompasses the information
associated to one or more functions and needed to interact with it (when
it differs from the ones of the Organization itself).

We should differentiate 3 different types of company:

* The buyers,

* The non-buying non-tendering organizations (e.g. Economic
operators, non-buying administrations or other organizations with which
tenderers may have to interact),

* The Tenderers and review requesters (e.g. Winners,
Subcontractors ...)

The table below specifies the requirements regarding Company/TouchPoint
information, which will be discussed in more details in the following
sections.

To point from any place within the instance to the appropriate set of
information (_Company_ or _TouchPoint_ related), a technical identifier
is defined following the rules summarized in <<technicalIdentifiersSchemesTable>> and marked-up
using "_cac:PartyIdentification/cbc:ID_".

[[buyerSection]]
=== Buyer

For a buyer, there may be a need to identify whether it is:

* a group leader,

* an awarding CPB,

* an acquiring CPB.

For Group Leader, the element "_efbc:GroupLeadIndicator_" is
not allowed if there is only one Buyer. If there is more than one
Buyer, then "_efbc:GroupLeadIndicator_" is mandatory for all Buyers,
and one Buyer shall have the value "true".

For Awarding CPB, the element "_efbc:AwardingCPBIndicator_" must either
be omitted for all Buyers, or included for all Buyers, at least one of
which should have the value "true".

For Acquiring CPB, the element "_efbc:AcquiringCPBIndicator_" must either
be omitted for all Buyers, or included for all Buyers, at least one of
which should have the value "true".


In addition to the usual Organization information, a unique technical
identifier shall be associated to the legal Organization. The value of
this identifier shall follow the rules reported in <<technicalIdentifiersSchemesTable>>.

For a function assumed by a given Buyer, when the associated contact
details differ from the ones of the Buyer and from the other ones
already defined as TouchPoint for that organization, a new TouchPoint
shall be defined. This TouchPoint also has a technical identifier
associated to it which should follow the scheme as reported in <<technicalIdentifiersSchemesTable>>.

=== Non-Tenderer, Non-Buyer

This section refers to organizations active during the Public
Procurement Procedure neither being a buyer nor a tenderer.

When the organization is an economic operator, an indicator may be used
to specify whether the legal person is a natural person or not (BT-633).

The element "_efbc:NaturalPersonIndicator_" must either
be omitted for all Non-Tenderer, Non-Buyer organizations, or included 
for all Non-Tenderer, Non-Buyer organizations. It is not allowed with 
the value "true" for an organization that has the BT-746 Winner Listed 
"_efbc:ListedOnRegulatedMarketIndicator_" element with value "true".

The "_efac:Company_" element groups all the elements relative to the legal
organization and the "_efac:TouchPoint_" element groups the contact
details for a given function assumed by the organization when these
differ from the ones of the legal organization.

A Mark-Up example is provided hereafter for an economic operator
providing Procurement Services to the buyer in the previous sectionfootnote:[The link between the Procurement service provider and the Buyer is made at another place in the instance.].

[[winnerTendererSection]]
=== Winner/tenderer

This section refers to economic operators that submitted a tender.

An indicator may be used to specify whether the legal person is a
natural person or not (BT-633). The value "true" specifies that 
the organization is a Natural Person and the value "false" 
specifies that the organization is a juridical person.

The element "_efbc:NaturalPersonIndicator_" must either
be omitted for all Tenderers and subcontractors, or included 
for all Tenderers and subcontractors. It is not allowed with the 
value "true" for an organization that has the BT-746 Winner Listed 
"_efbc:ListedOnRegulatedMarketIndicator_" element with value "true".

Another indicator may be used to specify whether this organization is
listed on a regulated market. When not listed, then links to the
Ultimate Business Owners shall be specified.

The element "_efbc:ListedOnRegulatedMarketIndicator_" must either
be omitted for all Tenderers and subcontractors, or included 
for all Tenderers and subcontractors. It is not allowed with the 
value "true" for an organization that has the BT-633 Organisation 
Natural Person "_efbc:NaturalPersonIndicator_" element with value 
"true".

== General structure of an organization related information

All Organizations are grouped under the same element
"_efac:Organizations_". They are organized as shown on <<overviewOrganizationsFigure>>.

[[overviewOrganizationsFigure]]
.Structure of the Organizations information
image::image025.jpg[image,width=605,height=337]

There are several pieces of information required for an organization.
The mapping with schema components is reported in <<mappingOrganizationBTsSchemaComponentsTable>>.

The business term Organization Notice Section Identifier (BT-13720) does
not have any equivalent in the XML since the elements used to mark the
organizations are referenced from the appropriate sections.

Each legal organization (i.e. in "efac:Company") is in a dedicated
"_efac:Organization_" element and its associated alternate contact
"_efac:TouchPoint_" (associated to one or more specific function) is
sibling of "efac:Company", therefore information of the legal
organization not part of the touchpoint information may be retrieved
from the legal organization to which the touchpoint is associated.

== Overview of roles, sub-roles and functions

Organizations assume specific functions (role/subrole) in different
contexts.

There are multiple roles and subroles defined, and subroles are only
accessible to organizations which already have a given role assigned;
the applicable restrictions are summarized in <<rolesVsSubrolesTable>>.

In eForms some roles and subroles have been identified and described
<<eFormsImpl>>. The following sections help mapping these with the appropriate
schema components.

For an appropriate understanding on how the different roles subroles
should be marked, there is a need for some initial clarifications.

=== Tendering Party versus Tenderer

Organizations may tender separately or jointly; when they tender
jointly, this may take different forms:

* Creation of a unique legal organization (e.g. joint venture),
in this case this new organization will be described (i.e. all its
information provided) at the Organizations level and referred to in the
Tendering Party section; or

* There is no legal entity created and the different
organizations are participating directly (e.g. consortium)

In this last case, when a reference to a tenderer or to a winner should
be made, it wouldn't be appropriate to refer to the organisations
individually but rather to the whole set of organizations acting
together, especially if an organization would be involved in different
"partnerships".

A tender is submitted either by an Organization of by a set of
organizations; it is more convenient to refer to this group without
having to refer to each organization individually. Also for the winner,
it is clearer to identify the group than identifying each member of the
group as winner, therefore an extra "function" needed to be defined
(i.e. the Tendering Party) composed of Tenderers. This also provides the
opportunity to identify at the same time the subcontractors and link
them to the main contractor they are working for. Let's first define the
two concepts of Tendering Party and Tenderer.

[quote,LawInsider,'link:https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/tendering-party[https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/tendering-party]']
____
*"Tendering Party"*means a party or parties as a group who has / have
participated in the tender process and submitted his / their tender in
response to an invitation to participate in the tender or a party /
parties who is / are prospective tenders qualified to participate in a
tender based on notice issued by the Company inviting tender.
____

[quote,LawInsider,'link:https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/tenderer[https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/tenderer]']
____
*"Tenderer"* means Bidder/ the Individual or Firm submitting Bids / Quotation / Tender.
____

Further details on Tendering Party (components, use and sample) may be
found in <<tenderingPartySection>>.

=== The winner

The results are provided per lot.

For a given lot, winners are the Tendering Parties for which the tender:

* Was submitted for that lot,

* Has been selected as part of the winning tenders, and

* A contract has been signed.

Therefore to identify a winner, there is a need to successively:

. Look for contracts referenced at the Lot Result,

. Identify the Tender that lead to the contract and is applied to
the lot covered by the Lot Resultfootnote:[While a Tender (let's call it global tender) may be submitted for multiple Lots and Group of lots, the concept of Tender in eForms (let's call it individual tender) is limited to the fragment of that global tender that relates to a single Lot or Group of lots. A signed Contract, however may cover multiple of these "individual" tenders.],

. From the identified tender identify its associated Tendering
Party.

From there it is also possible to identify each individual organization
that belongs to this Tendering Party.

=== Central Purchasing Bodies

CPBs are buyers and to reduce duplication of information it is enough to
distinguish with indicators whether a buyer is a CPB or not. Since there
are two different CPB possible, two different indicators have been
defined.

=== Group leader

A single subrole has been defined to cover two different concepts:

* Buyer group leader (in case of joint procurement), and

* Tenderer group leader (in the case of consortium or equivalent
association of tenderers)

For a buyer, the indication that the buyer is a group leader is attached
to the organization itself.

A tenderer may be involved in multiple Tendering Parties (i.e.
contribute collaboratively to different tenders) while he may have
different positions in each of them, therefore the specification whether
a given Tenderer is a group leader or not is indicated at the level of
the Tendering Party.

=== Subcontractor 

The role of subcontractor, and the main contractor it is providing
services to, are dependent from the Tendering Party the subcontractor is
involved in, therefore this information will be found inside the
TenderingParty element.

=== Roles & notices

Not all identified roles may exist in a notice (e.g. a winner may only
occur in a Contract Award Notice). The following table identifies the
requirement regarding the presence of the information for a given
role/subrole according to the type of notice.

The following convention has been used to report this information:

Let's consider that the organization tendered alone and has an
associated subcontractor (ORG-0005):

[source,xml]
----
<efac:TenderingParty>
    <cbc:ID schemeName="tendering-party">TPA-0001</cbc:ID>
    <efac:Tenderer>
        <cbc:ID schemeName="organization">ORG-0001</cbc:ID>
    </efac:Tenderer>
    <efac:SubContractor>
        <cbc:ID schemeName="organization">ORG-0005</cbc:ID>
        <efac:MainContractor>
            <cbc:ID schemeName="organization">ORG-0001</cbc:ID>
        </efac:MainContractor>
    </efac:SubContractor>
</efac:TenderingParty>
----

Any organization having a forefront role in a Tendering Party is a
Tenderer and the previously provided sample may be used as a paradigm
for its mark-up.

When a Tendering Party involves more than one tenderer:

* the indicator "_efbc:GroupLeadIndicator_" shall be used to
specify for any given tenderer whether it is a Group Leader or not;

* there shall exist one and only one Group Leader (indicator set
to "true").

The associated Tender is reported hereafter:

[source,xml]
----
<efac:LotTender>
    <cbc:ID schemeName="tender">TEN-0001</cbc:ID>
    <cbc:RankCode>1</cbc:RankCode>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
    <efac:TenderingParty>
        <!-- Reference to the tendering Party -->
        <cbc:ID schemeName="tendering-party">TPA-0001</cbc:ID>
    </efac:TenderingParty>
    <efac:TenderLot>
        <cbc:ID schemeName="LotsGroup">GLO-0005</cbc:ID>
    </efac:TenderLot>
</efac:LotTender>
----

As a winning tender, it will lead to the signature of a contract:

[source,xml]
----
<efac:SettledContract>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
    <cbc:ID schemeName="contract">CON-0001</cbc:ID>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
    <efac:LotTender>
        <!-- Reference to the Tender -->
        <cbc:ID schemeName="tender">TEN-0001</cbc:ID>
    </efac:LotTender>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
</efac:SettledContract>
----

The existence of contracts for the considered lot is specified by using
in the LotResult references to the contracts:

[source,xml]
----
<efac:LotResult>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
    <efac:SettledContract>
        <!-- Reference to a settled contract covering this lot -->
        <cbc:ID schemeName="contract">CON-0001</cbc:ID>
    </efac:SettledContract>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
    <efac:LotTender>
        <!-- Reference to the Tender -->
        <cbc:ID schemeName="tender">TEN-0001</cbc:ID>
    </efac:LotTender>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
    <efac:TenderLot>
        <!-- Reference to the Lot -->
        <cbc:ID schemeName="Lot">LOT-0001</cbc:ID>
    </efac:TenderLot>
</efac:LotResult>
----

For a LotResult:

* there may exist multiple Tenders, not all tenders are winning
tenders and multiple tenders could be issued by the same Tendering
Party,

* There may also be multiple winning tenders (e.g. Framework
Agreement),

Therefore, when identifying a specific winner of a lot (i.e. Tendering
Party associated to a winning tender for this lot), it is important to
identify the contract and its associated relevant tender.

=== Contract Signatory

The Contract Signatory(-ies) may be found in the "efac:SettledContract"
element and shall refer to the legal person that signs the contract from
the Buyer side.

[source,xml]
----
<efac:SettledContract>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
    <cbc:ID schemeName="contract">CON-0001</cbc:ID>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
    <cac:SignatoryParty>
        <!-- Reference to the Organization signing the contract -->
        <cbc:ID schemeName="organization">ORG-0001</cbc:ID>
    </cac:SignatoryParty>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
</efac:SettledContract>
----

"cac:SignatoryParty" is repeatable to report as many signatories as
needed.

=== Financing & Paying Organizations

The Financing and Paying Parties may be found in the "_efac:LotResult_"
element. References shall be made to the legal person assuming the role:

[source,xml]
----
<efac:LotResult>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
    <cac:FinancingParty>
        <!-- Reference to the organization financing the project -->
        <cac:PartyIdentification>
            <cbc:ID schemeName="organization">ORG-0001</cbc:ID>
        </cac:PartyIdentification>
    </cac:FinancingParty>
    <cac:PayerParty>
        <!-- Reference to the organization performing payments -->
        <cac:PartyIdentification>
            <cbc:ID schemeName="organization">ORG-0001</cbc:ID>
        </cac:PartyIdentification>
    </cac:PayerParty>
    <!-- Interrupted Mark-Up -->
    <efac:TenderLot>
        <!-- Reference to the Lot -->
        <cbc:ID schemeName="Lot">LOT-0001</cbc:ID>
    </efac:TenderLot>
</efac:LotResult>
----

"cac:FinancingParty" and "cac:PayerParty" are repeatable to allow for
reporting of as many parties as needed.

=== Legislation Information Provider

There are 3 types of such organizations, one for each of the followings:

* Employment,

* Environment,

* Tax.

These roles are to be found at the Lot level:
