# The `codelists` folder

This folder provides the controlled vocabularies used in eForms notices. The format used is the [Genericode](https://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/genericode/doc/oasis-code-list-representation-genericode.html) file format. 

The `codelists.json` file serves as an index listing all the codelists available in this folder together with some essential metadata about each of them (like its identifier, filename, description etc.).

Documentation on how to use the metadata provided in this folder can be found at <https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/codelists>.

## SDK 2: Backwards compatibility
:heavy_check_mark: **No breaking changes** in the metadata provided in this folder have been introduced by SDK 2. Metadata driven applications built on top of SDK 1 should be able to use the metadata provided in this folder without any changes.
